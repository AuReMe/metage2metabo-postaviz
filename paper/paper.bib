    abstract  = {{The field of microbiome research has evolved rapidly over the past few decades and has become a topic of great scientific and public interest. As a result of this rapid growth in interest covering different fields, we are lacking a clear commonly agreed definition of the term “microbiome.” Moreover, a consensus on best practices in microbiome research is missing. Recently, a panel of international experts discussed the current gaps in the frame of the European-funded MicrobiomeSupport project. The meeting brought together about 40 leaders from diverse microbiome areas, while more than a hundred experts from all over the world took part in an online survey accompanying the workshop. This article excerpts the outcomes of the workshop and the corresponding online survey embedded in a short historical introduction and future outlook. We propose a definition of microbiome based on the compact, clear, and comprehensive description of the term provided by Whipps et al. in 1988, amended with a set of novel recommendations considering the latest technological developments and research findings. We clearly separate the terms microbiome and microbiota and provide a comprehensive discussion considering the composition of microbiota, the heterogeneity and dynamics of microbiomes in time and space, the stability and resilience of microbial networks, the definition of core microbiomes, and functionally relevant keystone species as well as co-evolutionary principles of microbe-host and inter-species interactions within the microbiome. These broad definitions together with the suggested unifying concepts will help to improve standardization of microbiome studies in the future, and could be the starting point for an integrated assessment of data resulting in a more rapid transfer of knowledge from basic science into practice. Furthermore, microbiome standards are important for solving new challenges associated with anthropogenic-driven changes in the field of planetary health, for which the understanding of microbiomes might play a key role.

Yet, as we learn more about the complex microbe–microbe and microbe–environment interactions in microbial communities, it is important to understand whether and how system-level approaches can be extended to the ecosystem level. Here we summarize recent work that addresses these challenges at multiple scales, starting from two-species natural and synthetic ecology models, up to biosphere-level approaches. Among the many fascinating open challenges in this field is whether the integration of high throughput sequencing methods and mathematical models will help us capture emerging principles of ecosystem-level metabolic organization and evolution.}},

  abstract  = {{The incidence of cardiometabolic diseases is increasing globally, and both poor diet and the human gut microbiome have been implicated1. However, the field lacks large-scale, comprehensive studies exploring these links in diverse populations2. Here, in over 34,000 US and UK participants with metagenomic, diet, anthropometric and host health data, we identified known and yet-to-be-cultured gut microbiome species associated significantly with different diets and risk factors. We developed a ranking of species most favourably and unfavourably associated with human health markers, called the ‘ZOE Microbiome Health Ranking 2025’. This system showed strong and reproducible associations between the ranking of microbial species and both body mass index and host disease conditions on more than 7,800 additional public samples. In an additional 746 people from two dietary interventional clinical trials, favourably ranked species increased in abundance and prevalence, and unfavourably ranked species reduced over time. In conclusion, these analyses provide strong support for the association of both diet and microbiome with health markers, and the summary system can be used to inform the basis for future causal and mechanistic studies. It should be emphasized, however, that causal inference is not possible without prospective cohort studies and interventional clinical trials.}},

We present Metage2Metabo (M2M) a resource that meets the need for de-novo functional screening of genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMNs) at the scale of a metagenome, and the identification of critical species with respect to metabolic cooperation. M2M comprises a flexible pipeline for the characterisation of individual metabolisms and collective metabolic complementarity. In addition, M2M identifies key species, that are meaningful members of the community for functions of interest. We demonstrate that M2M is applicable to collections of genomes as well as metagenome-assembled genomes, permits an efficient GSMN reconstruction with Pathway Tools, and assesses the cooperation potential between species. M2M identifies key organisms by reducing the complexity of a large-scale microbiota into minimal communities with equivalent properties, suitable for further analyses.}},

    abstract  = {{Building models is essential for understanding the functions and dynamics of microbial communities. Metabolic models built on genome‐scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are especially relevant as a means to decipher the complex interactions occurring among species. Model reconstruction increasingly relies on metagenomics, which permits direct characterisation of naturally occurring communities that may contain organisms that cannot be isolated or cultured. In this review, we provide an overview of the field of metabolic modelling and its increasing reliance on and synergy with metagenomics and bioinformatics. We survey the means of assigning functions and reconstructing metabolic networks from (meta‐)genomes, and present the variety and mathematical fundamentals of metabolic models that foster the understanding of microbial dynamics. We emphasise the characterisation of interactions and the scaling of model construction to large communities, two important bottlenecks in the applicability of these models. We give an overview of the current state of the art in metagenome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, focusing on the reconstruction of genomes in microbial communities. Metagenomics benefits tremendously from third‐generation sequencing, and we discuss the opportunities of long‐read sequencing, strain‐level characterisation and eukaryotic metagenomics. We aim at providing algorithmic and mathematical support, together with tool and application resources, that permit bridging the gap between metagenomics and metabolic modelling. With this review we articulate two important topics in the context of deciphering the role and functions of microbial communities: metabolic modeling and metagenomics. We survey the methodological approaches, highlight the changes raised by third generation sequencing, and provide resources to bridge the gaps between the sequencing reads and the models.}},

The relevance of microbial communities is increasing due to growing awareness of their influence on a huge number of environmental, health and industrial processes. Hence, being able to control and engineer the output of both natural and synthetic communities would be of great interest. However, most of the available methods and biotechnological applications involving microorganisms, both in vivo and in silico, have been developed in the context of isolated microbes. In vivo microbial consortia development is extremely difficult and costly because it implies replicating suitable environments in the wet-lab. Computational approaches are thus a good, cost-effective alternative to study microbial communities, mainly via descriptive modelling, but also via engineering modelling. In this review we provide a detailed compilation of examples of engineered microbial communities and a comprehensive, historical revision of available computational metabolic modelling methods to better understand, and rationally engineer wild and synthetic microbial communities.}},

For large, diverse microbial communities, prediction of these capabilities is limited by uncertainty about metabolic functions and environmental conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a probabilistic method, inspired by percolation theory, to computationally quantify how robustly a genome-derived metabolic network produces a given set of metabolites under an ensemble of variable environments. We used this method to compile an atlas of predicted biosynthetic capabilities for 97 metabolites across 456 human oral microbes. This atlas captures taxonomically-related trends in biomass composition, and makes it possible to estimate inter-microbial metabolic distances that correlate with microbial co-occurrences. We also found a distinct cluster of fastidious/uncultivated taxa, including several Saccharibacteria (TM7) species, characterized by their abundant metabolic deficiencies. By embracing uncertainty, our approach can be broadly applied to understanding metabolic interactions in complex microbial ecosystems.}},
