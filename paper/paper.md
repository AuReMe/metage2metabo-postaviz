# Summary

Microbial communities consist of up to thousands of distinct microbial populations, each characterized by its genomic DNA sequences, and all sharing a habitat and environmental conditions. The word _microbiome_ describe the holistic concept associated all the previous components [@Berg.2020]. Understanding roles of and interactions within the microbiome requires a combination of experimentation, high-throughput data acquisition and computation models according to the framework of systems biology extended to microbial ecosystems [@Klitgord.2011]. The role of microbial populations can be abstracted by the study of their metabolism, encompassing all biochemical reactions that cells performs. The genome encodes the genetic information associated to the metabolism, and can therefore be queried to estimate the capabilities of microorganisms. Because such metabolism is highly redundant and because of the size of microbial communities, computational models are needed to reconstruct metabolic networks and predict the possible behaviours of and interactions within microbial populations in given environmental conditions. Comparing the outcomes of such predictive models in multiple samples further increases the difficulty of integrating results into actionable hypotheses. Visualisation and integration of metadata can help perform such comparison. They need to be as customisable as possible to facilitate exploration by end-users.  

# Statement of need

Metabolic modelling is widely used to determine the roles of microorganisms in microbial communities [@Cerk.2024]: what molecules they can produce, which interactions are likely to happen depending on the environmental conditions... Many models rely on integer linear programming optimisations [@García-Jimenez.2021] and some alternatives use Boolean abstractions [@Frioux.2018] [@Belcour.2020] or probabilistic approaches [@Bernstein.2019] to provide predictions on community behaviours. A key question is scalability in predictions and analysis of these predictions when analysing many community compositions. Each microorganism is abstracted by a collection of biochemical reactions it may perform according to its genomic information, thus forming a network connecting transformed molecules. A community of microorganisms is therefore represented as a collection of such networks, referred to as genome-scale metabolic networks. A metabolic model will provide predictions on the possible behaviour of microorganisms and communities in defined simulation conditions.

`M2M-PostaViz` is a Python package that performs analyses on the predictions generated by the metabolic-modelling tool `Metage2Metabo` (M2M) [@Belcour.2020]. M2M screens the metabolic potential of a microbial community represented as a collection of genome-scale metabolic networks. When working with cohorts of hundreds or thousands of samples, one has to run the tool as many times as there are samples, then analyse the results of the model. The tool's output are, for each community, several data frames describing the role of each microorganism with respect to the whole community's functions. Properly comparing all samples requires combining all the outputs, and taking into account sample metadata describing individuals lifestyle or health characteristics for instance.

`M2M-PostaViz` integrates all such data and provides a visualisation interface that permits exploration through custom plot generation and statistical tests. The underlying data treatment was optimised in order to deal with large numbers of samples without impeding user experience. `M2M-PostaViz` notably permits a pre-treatment and storage of the data such that future exploration can be launched in a computationally efficient manner. Exploration is performed at several levels: molecules (metabolites) that may or may not be producible across samples, microorganisms that may have different behaviours across samples depending on interactions with other community members, or more general overviews of the  community functions.
